The interface for weekly guest speakers was designed to resize well on various screens and to convey crucial information in an efficient manner. I chose to use a calendar interface metaphor, with each card representing a different week and speaker. I also chose to include a photo of the speaker rather than a company logo to echo the humanistic values of our decal.
